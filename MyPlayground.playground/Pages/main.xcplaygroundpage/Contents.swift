 */
/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here
func helloWorld() {
    let greeting = "Hello, world!"
    print(greeting)
}

helloWorld()




/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here



func declareC() {
    let jars = "jelly"
    print (jars)
}

declareC()

/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

func newPerson(name: String) {
    print ("How are you, \(name)?")
}
newPerson("Justin")

/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
var lars = "Donnie"
newPerson(lars)




/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign it to a new variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here

func sayHello() {
    let personName = "Jen"
    let greeting = "Hello, " + personName + "!"
    print (greeting)
}
sayHello()
